SUGGESTED REFRACTOR! ONLY USE THIS HAS REFERENCE!

1. Split the file into smaller components
Problem: Your Profile.js is doing way too much. It includes helpers, UI, API calls, business logic, and state management in one place. This is hard to maintain and will eventually break as the app grows.

Solution:

Move each self-contained chunk (e.g., ActivityItem, FriendItem, CommentSection, StatCard) into its own component file in /components/profile/ or similar.

Move helpers like getWallpaperUrl, getDefaultCover, and inventory stuff into a profileUtils.js.

Create a /hooks/ folder and move your big custom logic hooks there, e.g., useProfileData, useWallPosts, useWallpaper.

2. Centralize data fetching and caching
Problem: Fetching logic (profile, wall posts, friends) is repeated, sometimes optimistic, sometimes with caching. It’s hard to reason about and debug.

Solution:

Use a single useProfileData(username) hook to handle all profile data, relationships, and friends. Cache inside the hook (local/session storage or a state manager like Zustand if you want, but keep it simple for now).

Use a useWallPosts(username) hook to handle wall fetching, paginating, creating, deleting, liking, unliking. Expose nice methods: addComment, deleteComment, likePost, etc.

Consider using React Query (now called TanStack Query) for all API data. It’ll give you caching, invalidation, optimistic updates, and error handling for free.

3. Remove all unnecessary inline logic
Problem: You have a lot of anonymous functions, deeply nested callbacks, and inline business logic in your render methods and useEffects.

Solution:

Define all event handlers and business logic outside the JSX body, or use hooks to return handlers.

Inline rendering code (like mapping wall posts to components) is okay, but try to keep all pure logic outside render.

4. Type safety and prop validation
Problem: It’s easy to break things if you pass wrong props, and there are places where data can be undefined or in the wrong shape.

Solution:

Add PropTypes (if you’re not using TypeScript yet).
Example:

js
Copy
Edit
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
FriendItem.propTypes = {
  username: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  avatar: PropTypes.string,
  status: PropTypes.string,
  online: PropTypes.bool
}
Or migrate to TypeScript gradually for even better safety.

5. Move styles to Tailwind or CSS modules
You already use Tailwind – keep all styling in the markup, and avoid custom inline styles or ad-hoc classNames unless needed for dynamic logic.

6. Handle side effects and subscriptions carefully
Problem: Your useEffects sometimes have a lot of logic, and may get out of sync with changing dependencies.

Solution:

Always clean up subscriptions (window.addEventListener, API polling, etc.) in the cleanup function.

If you have to depend on context or props, make sure you include them in the dependency array.

7. Error boundaries and user feedback
Add a top-level error boundary to catch unexpected crashes in Profile and its children.

Centralize notification logic instead of passing setNotification everywhere.

8. Document with comments and JSDoc
Keep every exported function/component documented for what it does, expected props, and side effects.

Summary:
Break up the monolith: move all UI blocks into components, and logic into hooks.

Centralize all data fetching and caching.

Use React Query for fetching if possible.

Add prop validation.

Keep business logic out of render.

Always clean up side effects.

Add error boundaries and notifications.

Write JSDoc for any custom logic or helpers.

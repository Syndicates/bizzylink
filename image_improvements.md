# Minecraft Image Integration Improvements

## Problems Fixed
- Fixed broken SVG images throughout the website
- Eliminated dependency on static SVG files in public directory
- Added dynamic loading of Minecraft item images from reliable APIs
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for image loading failures
- Improved visual consistency of Minecraft items across components

## New Components
1. **MinecraftItem**: Reusable component for displaying any Minecraft item with:
   - Automatic API integration with multiple fallbacks
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Hover animations and tooltips
   - Pixelated rendering for authentic Minecraft look

2. **MinecraftInventory**: Component for displaying item grids similar to Minecraft inventories:
   - Configurable grid layout
   - Support for item stacks and durability
   - Item selection and interaction
   - Proper Minecraft-style item tooltips

3. **MinecraftAvatar**: Component for displaying player heads and models:
   - Different view types (head, bust, full body)
   - UUID and username support
   - Integration with multiple player rendering APIs
   - Animations and hover effects

## API Integration
- Created a comprehensive Minecraft API service that connects to:
  - MineAPI (mineatar.io) for high-quality item renders
  - MC-Heads for alternative item textures
  - Crafatar for player heads and avatars
  - Visage for 3D player renders
  - PlayerDB for player information

- Implemented intelligent fallback chain:
  1. Primary API attempt
  2. Secondary API fallback
  3. Local SVG file fallback
  4. Default placeholder

## Implementation Details
- Updated Login page to use MinecraftItem for grass block

- Updated Navigation bar with proper Minecraft icons
- Updated Notification system with themed Minecraft items
- Updated LoadingSpinner to use MinecraftItem
- Added name normalization to support different item naming conventions
- Implemented proper error handling throughout the image loading process

## Benefits
- More authentic Minecraft visual experience
- Better performance through cached API responses
- Higher quality item and player renders
- More consistent UI across the application
- Reduced bundle size by eliminating need for many static assets
- Simplified maintenance as new items can be displayed without adding SVG files

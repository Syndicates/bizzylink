/**
 * Debug script to test profile authentication and Change Cover button visibility
 */

// This script will help us understand:
// 1. Is the user authenticated?
// 2. Is isOwnProfile being calculated correctly?
// 3. Is the refactored Profile component being used?

console.log(`
🔍 DEBUG CHECKLIST FOR CHANGE COVER BUTTON ISSUE:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to your profile page
3. Look for these debug messages:

Expected console output:
- [DynamicProfile] Rendering: { useLegacyProfile: false, profileType: "Refactored", ... }
- [useProfileData] isOwnProfile calculation: { user: "yourUsername", isOwn: true, ... }
- [ProfileHeader] Debug info: { isOwnProfile: true, onWallpaperSelect: "function" }

If you see any of these issues:
❌ useLegacyProfile: true -> You're using the old Profile.js (add ?legacy=false to URL)
❌ isOwn: false -> Authentication issue or wrong profile page
❌ onWallpaperSelect: "undefined" -> Props not being passed correctly

4. Look for the Change Cover button:
   - Should appear in bottom-right of cover image if isOwnProfile is true
   - If you see "DEBUG: Not own profile" instead, authentication is the issue

5. Test the button click:
   - Should show "[ProfileHeader] Change Cover button clicked!" in console
   - Should open wallpaper selection modal

Common Issues:
1. Not logged in -> Login required for Change Cover to appear
2. Viewing someone else's profile -> Only shows on your own profile
3. Using legacy profile -> Add ?legacy=false to URL to use refactored version
4. Profile loading error -> Check network tab for API errors

URL Examples:
- Your profile: http://localhost:3000/profile/yourusername
- Force refactored: http://localhost:3000/profile/yourusername?legacy=false
- Force legacy: http://localhost:3000/profile/yourusername?legacy=true
